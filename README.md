# Car analysis
The webpage was created using ANVIL, which is a web app builder using python. 
It makes car analysis based on the input given by the user. 
In the first part, the user can choose a category and based on the category, the cars with the maximum and minimum value of the category with the car model,variant and company name will be displayed. 
In the second part, the user can choose the value for the x and y axis so that based on the value they selected, a graph will be displayed. 
In the third part, the user should enter values for the category they wish so that based on the value they entered, the approximate price of the car will be displayed(If no value is chosen, then it will automatically take the least value for calculation).
